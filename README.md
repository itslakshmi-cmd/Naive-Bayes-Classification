# Naive Bayes Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Naive Bayes classification model** using Python. The goal is to demonstrate how probabilistic machine learning algorithms can be applied to classification problems through proper data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
  - Based on Bayes’ Theorem
  - Assumes independence among features
  - Efficient and fast for large datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualization)

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training using Naive Bayes  
5. Model evaluation and performance analysis  

## 📈 Results
The Naive Bayes model showed good performance and accuracy, proving its effectiveness for classification tasks, especially when working with structured data and independent features.

## 🚀 Applications
- Spam detection  
- Text classification  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Predictive analytics  

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `Naive_Bayes.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Compare performance with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree)
- Apply hyperparameter tuning
- Use larger and more complex datasets
